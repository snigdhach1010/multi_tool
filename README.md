This project is a smart assistant built using a Large Language Model (LLM). It takes a user’s input, breaks it down into smaller tasks, and picks the best tool to get each part done.
Think of it like an AI brain that can:
- Do math
- Run Python code
- Summarize documents
- Search for information (simulated)
- How It Works

1. You give it a task — like "Summarize this PDF" or "Calculate 87 x 42".
2. The agent sends it to a task planner, which breaks it into smaller steps.
3. Each step goes through a tool router that picks the best tool for the job.
4. The system uses a memory module to remember context across steps.
5. A special LLM module helps generate prompts and understand results.
6. Calculator – Does simple math
7. Code Runner – Runs Python code snippets
8. Text Summarizer – Summarizes long documents
9. Web Search (Mock) – Pretends to search online

How To Run

1. Open your terminal  
2. Make sure your Python environment is set up  
3. Install the required libraries:
4. Start the project:
5. Then follow the prompts on screen!


Why I Built This

I created this to show how we can connect an LLM with real tools and build something useful, modular, and expandable. It’s a simple version of what AI agents can do in real-world scenarios.
